# Microservices Intro App

This project is intended to be an introduction to the microservices architecture and many of the technologies behing it. It follows along with the book "Spring Microservices in Action" (https://www.manning.com/books/spring-microservices-in-action-second-edition) by John Carnell and Illary Haylupo Sanchez. 

I took on this project as a means to discover and try out new tools like Docker, Spring HATEOAS, Spring Cloud Configuration Server, JWT, Spring Actuator and many other projects and technologies to further my skillset. Once finished with this project I plan to make use of many of these technologies to rebuild the TripLeader project (https://github.com/diegoalej/TripLeader) in a more efficient and secure manner.
